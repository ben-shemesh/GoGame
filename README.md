This is a repo that demonstrates the possibilities (not entirely ideal) of creating a very basic game in go. This is in no way comprehensive or display the most optimal way to create a game but
displays the capabilities of using Go. Channels Go routines and pointers are displayed and to show what is possible.
This is also a way for me to learn and track my progress in Go. 🐹
